# latexnotes
A simple Latex note editor that allows you to dynamically search for common LaTex operations as you are editing and then insert them into the editor at the cursor's location.

As you type LaTex, it will dynamically render the LaTex in a preview pane on the right side of the window. You can then export the notes or just the raw LaTex to a more robust editor and layout software.

8/5/18: Added `localstorage` support, so closing your browser window won't lose all your work.

You can try out the app [here](http://latexnotes.surge.sh/).
